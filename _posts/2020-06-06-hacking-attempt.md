I've got alert mails from my server when I took a rest in cafe.

When I checked my server I've found that was set allowing from abroad connection.

So I took setting to block a connection from abroad by my tablet computer.

It's wrong setting by my mistake. I've forgot that is set allowing the connection on the server after Germany business trip.

The server have another defending way, but let's be careful and careful again anyway.
