![log](/upload/zod.png "log")

I have decided open a source code of Zod without database file on Github repository recently because I don't launch it anymore on IRC because many environmental factors have been changed.

You can access the code on https://github.com/cypherod/Zod and can use it freely anywhere and anytime.
